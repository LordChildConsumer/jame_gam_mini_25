# Theme: Don't get surrounded
# Special Object: Aerial vehicle

## Strategy:
Make the best version of the most obvious game

## Game Brief:
You are playing as a pilot caught behind enemy lines.. and you've run out of ammo for your guns! Pilot your craft to dodge enemy attacks and cause collateral damage. Stay alive until reinforcements come (if they ever come).

## Basic actions: 
Use WASD to steer your vehicle. Pitch left and right with A and D. Accelerate with W. Decelerate with S. 

## Complex actions: 
- If you go too slow your plane will begin to nosedive. Make sure your aircraft stays above a minimum speed.
- dodge enemy attacks
- Bait enemy planes into shoot at you, and dodge at the last second making their attacks hit their allies
- Bait enemy planes into running into each other.

## Challenges:
- Enemy plane AI

## Visual Art Assets Required:
- Sky blue background with a cloud layer that can infinitely tile.
- Character plane in a "friendly" colour like blue or green
- Enemy planes in red/black/gold, maybe a couple different "tier"s of planes (i.e. one gold stripe on the wing for level 1, 3 gold stripes on the wing for more hp planes)
- A UI element for your planes speedomoeter. Should have a red area near the bottom to indicate where "TOO SLOW" is.
- Choose a font that matches the art style
- A title text (don't need an image, just the title in a fancy art piece that we can put on top of the game screen at the beginning of the game).
- victory splash (just a "Victory!" text drawn)
- Defeat splash (just "Defeat" hand drawn)

## Sound Assets:
- Plane sounds (idling, revving, decelerating)
- Plane gun sounds
- Lighthearted fast battle music (looping)
- A victory sfx
- Losing sfx

## Programming requirements:
- Plane movement
- "pitching" for turning. (Kawaii I think this is where your specialty "make it feel good" talent would come in handy.)
- acceleration and decelleration.
- enemy planes spawn and fly straight
